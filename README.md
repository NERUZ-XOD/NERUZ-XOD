# 👋 Hey there, I'm Neeraj

This is my space on the internet where I build stuff, break stuff, and learn along the way.

I’m into code, creativity, and making things that actually work. Right now, I’m focused on app development, learning new tech, and solving real-world problems with clean, functional code.
